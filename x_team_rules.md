# X-Team 70 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
  1. Collectively discuss high-level structure of the program.
  1. Split the work into divisible equal parts
  1. Distribute by who says what they want first
  1. Then give based on equality of workload and members' strengths and weaknesses
  1. If two people want the same assignment, discuss and come to an agreement. Consult the whole group. Worst case, rock paper scissors
  1. While each member begins to complete their tasks, they can ask to reevaluate distribution if they feel the group would be better served if another member completed the task. This could happen if they are struggling with their task, or if the group realizes that two tasks rely on the other one's code too closely and should be programmed by the same person. The group will discuss.
  1. Each member is responsible for commenting their own code.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Create a new file in this repository for each project and check what changes were made. We will set small deadlines for various sections of the assignment (i.e. implementation of insert method must have full functionality by __ date). After each section is finished, the group will collectively look over the section and look for possible improvements in effeciency and readability. After the entire project is finished, we will review the high-level structure of the program and look for redundencies and possible simplifications.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Facebook messenger discussions, making sure that the confusion is discussed until each member understands.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

We will schedule check-in dates over the course of the project. If one of us is struggling to create their content, they will consult the 
group and dask distribution will be reconsidered
