# X-Team 70 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
  1. The high-level structure of the project will be discussed so that each member understands how the code should function. 
  1. The work will be split into equal parts.
  1. If a team member has particular interest in writing a specific portion of the code, he/she may claim responsibility for writing it.
  1. The remainder of the code will be divided up among the remaining team members based on strengths and understanding of concepts until responsibility of all portions are claimed.
  1. If two people want the same assignment, the team will discuss it and come to an agreement. If need be, a ravishing best 2 of 3 game or roshambo will be the deciding factor.
  1. While each member begins to complete their tasks, they can ask to reevaluate distribution if they feel the group would be better served if another member completed the task. This could happen if they are struggling with their task, or if the group realizes that two tasks rely on each others' code too closely and should be programmed by the same person. The group will meet each case with a new discussion and a unique solution will be created to resolve the discrepancy.
  1. Each member is responsible for commenting their own code. Commenting should be descriptive and follow the style guide.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

Create a new file in this repository for each project and check what changes were made. We will set small deadlines for various sections of the assignment (i.e. implementation of insert method must have full functionality by __ date). After each section is finished, the group will collectively look over the section and look for possible improvements in effeciency and readability. After the entire project is finished, we will review the high-level structure of the program and look for redundencies and possible simplifications.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

Our primary form of communication will be through Facebook messenger. Minor difficulties can be addressed in the chat, while more challenging issues should be approached more rigorously. A 1:1 meeting with another team member or a small subset of the group could be arranged in the case of an approaching dealine, but otherwise the team member experiencing the difficulty sohould prepare to present their issue at the weekly team meeting so that it can be handled quickly and efficiently.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed

We will schedule check-in dates over the course of the project. Progress should also be assessed at the weekly team meetings. If a team member is struggling to create their content, they will consult the group and task distribution will be reconsidered if necessary.
