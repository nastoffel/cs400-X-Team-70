# X-Team 70 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
  1. split the work into divisible equal parts
  2. distribute by who says what they want first
  3. then give based on equality of workload
  4. if two people want the same assignment, discuss and come to an agreement
  5. worst case, RPS


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
